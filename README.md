**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL** is the process of analyzing and summarizing a dataset using SQL queries to uncover patterns, trends, relationships, and anomalies in the data. EDA helps to understand the structure and characteristics of the data, which is crucial for making informed decisions during the data analysis or modeling phase.

### Key Steps in SQL-Based EDA:
1. **Understanding the Dataset:**
   - Use `SELECT` statements with `LIMIT` to inspect sample rows.
   - Analyze schema details using queries like `DESCRIBE` or `SHOW COLUMNS`.

2. **Data Profiling:**
   - Check for null or missing values using `COUNT`, `IS NULL`, and `IS NOT NULL`.
   - Examine data types and distributions using `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`).

3. **Identifying Patterns and Trends:**
   - Aggregate and summarize data with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
   - Analyze time-based trends with date functions.

4. **Uncovering Relationships:**
   - Use `JOIN` statements to combine tables and discover relationships.
   - Perform correlation analysis using calculated fields.

5. **Handling Outliers and Anomalies:**
   - Detect outliers using conditional logic (`CASE` or `WHERE` clauses) and statistical thresholds.
   - Investigate anomalies with specific filters.

6. **Data Visualization and Insights:**
   - While SQL lacks native visualization tools, export query results to visualization software like Tableau or Power BI.
   - Use complex queries to create datasets ready for visualization.

SQL provides a powerful and flexible framework for performing EDA, enabling analysts to query, clean, and transform data effectively while preparing it for deeper analysis or visualization.
